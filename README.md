ForestQuery into Global Deforestation, 1990 to 2016


Post Analysis Recommendations : 

According to World Bank data from 1990 to 2016, our world forest area is shrinking due to forest area loss of two regions Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America & Caribbean. All other regions increased in forest area over this time period.
	
The data suggest that, we should focus on the countries facing major decrement in forest area. Those countries are Brazil, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nigeria, and Tanzania. Countries like Togo, Nigeria, Uganda, Mauritania, Honduras also at risk for loosing high percentage of forest which may impact them as individual. Nigeria is the most concerned country to be focus on and needs initiative as quickly as possible in order to sustain. We can start campaign to understand the exact situation over here. 

As a success China has shown remarkable increase in its forest land. Hence, we should acquire some best practices from them to implement. As a whole world initiative, we should enforce some rules for all countries to protect their forest.
